# Nexar Landing (GitHub practice)

Simple static website for practicing GitHub workflow:
- branches
- pull requests
- code review
- resolving conflicts
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in a browser.

## Suggested tasks for teammates
1. Update schedule table
2. Add a new FAQ item
3. Improve styles (small changes)
4. Add a "Location" section and link it in the nav
5. Create a conflict intentionally (edit same line in README in two branches)
